#Collaboration with a Workspace

{{ book.productName }} allows multiple users to collaborate on the same [workspace](workspaces.md) much like Google Docs.
To view the list of users the workspace is shared with, click on the "Spaces" icon on the menubar and click on the gear next
 to the workspace name. If you have `Edit` [access](data-access-control.md) to that [workspace](workspaces.md), you may
 modify the list of users.

After a [workspace](workspaces.md) is shared with you and depending on your access to the [workspace](workspaces.md), you
can add comments or change the [properties](properties.md) of the [entities](vertices.md) and [relationships](edges.md)
for other users to reply to or view.


# Collaborating Without a Workspace
[Collaboration](colaboration.md) is also possible even when a [workspace](workspaces.md) is not shared through
[sandboxing](sandboxing-and-publishing.md).


Starting with a [workspace](workspaces.md) that only you have access to, you may create, modify, or delete [entities](vertices.md).
If changes are made and [published](sandboxing-and-publishing.md) (through the modification panel), those changes are then
visible to any {{ book.productName }}  user based on
the visibility attached to the entity and [properties](properties.md). A default [visibility](data-access-control.md)
of “public” is added to each entity until changed.

#<center> Entities </center>

As one of the three types of data in {{ book.productName }}, entities are nodes in the graph that can have
[properties](properties.md) and [relationships](edges.md) to other entities. These entities exist to represent the
different concept types in a visual format.

Depending on the concept type of the entity, there is a specific list of possible [relationships](edges.md) to other
entities, and a specific list of [properties](properties.md) that can be used.  Also there are different icons that are
used to represent each concept type.

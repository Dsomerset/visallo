# Relationships

Relationships are the associations between [entities](entities.md). Relationships exist to show connections between two
different entities.

For example, through a relationship, you will be able to see that John Smith knows Jane Doe. It provides a more visual
representation of what anyone else would be reading on a table or notes. Examples of relationships that may exist in
{{ book.productName }}  include, but are not limited to: `Contains Image of`, `Has Entity`, `Has Met`, `Has Image`,
`Knows` and `Works For`.

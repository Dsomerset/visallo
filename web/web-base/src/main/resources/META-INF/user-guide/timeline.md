#<center> Timeline </center>

The `TIMELINE` feature displays entities that have date [properties](properties.md) in chronological order as a
timeline/bar view on the graph.  It can be found on the bottom left-hand corner of {{ book.productName }} regardless
if you have the [dashboard](dashboards.md), [graph](graph.md), or [map](map.md) opened. If an entity is clicked on in
the timeline, the details panel will open. Hovering over the bar will provide the exact date and
time of the entity.  Zooming in closely to the entity on the bar will also provide the same result.


The option to `FIT`  is included here as well. The different date [properties](properties.md), such as `Birth Date` or
`Date Taken`, will be shown in different colors in the timeline. A portion of the timeline can also be highlighted to
display all the dates within that time  period and by clicking and dragging on the bottom half, it can be panned.

# Security

Security is baked into the core of Visallo. Given the increased sensitivity and the importance to protect data, Visallo
was built to authenticate users as well as protect data down to any attribute. There are different accesses per
 user, per [workspace](workspaces.md), and per [entity](vertices.md) and [relationship](edges.md) which will be
 discussed in more detail in [Access Control](data-access-control.md) and [Application Privileges](application-privilages.md).

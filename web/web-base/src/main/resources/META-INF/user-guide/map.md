# Map

{{ book.productName }} provides a map view of [workspace](workspaces.md) data that has geolocation
[properties](properties.md); it displays the entities.

## Fitting, Panning, and Zooming the Map

Viewing large amounts of geolocation data on a map can be overwhelming.  To improve the user experience, Visallo
provides several options navigate the contents.

Fit: <Fit image here> resets your view and arranges the map so that all entities are easily visible.
Zoom: Using the + or - keys or your keyboard allow you to zoom in/out.  Alternatively, you can use your mouse/track pad
to zoom in/out.
Arrows: Using the arrow keys on the graph allows you to pan up, down, left, or right.


## Viewing Or Loading Results on the Map
Users are able to view/load results that appear within a certain radius. This can be accomplished by going into the
[search](search.md) panel and choosing the geolocation [[property](properties.md)](properties.md) to filter by.  Next,
select the option to “[search](search.md) on map” and then highlight a certain area to see if there are entities within
the highlighted radius.

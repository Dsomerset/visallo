# Search

{{ book.productName }} provides two methods of searching by default:

- [{{ book.productName }} Search](visallo-search.md)
- [Find On Graph](find-on-graph.md)

To search, click the `Find` option <img src = images/menubar-find.png width="30"> in the menubar.
Searches can help find information you are looking for or view other things that would be in the system that you wouldnâ€™t
know about.

For example, if another user creates an entity and publishes it, you can find that published entity in search. A `*`
search can be executed to view any and all results that are in the system.  If an entity has a specified authorization,
then any user without that authorization can not see the entity also while they are searching.

# Find On Graph

The `Workspace` tab of the [search](search.md) panel allows you to identify [entities](vertices.md) on the
[graph](graph.md) that match the specified criteria. This is useful when you are trying to find specific [entities](vertices.md)
and/or [relationships](edges.md) amongst the potentially vast amount of
 [entities](vertices.md) and
[relationships](edges.md) that can exist on the [workspace](workspaces.md).

As an added benefit, any entities and/or relationships that are highlighted as a result of a search will be displayed on
the [histogram](detail-pane.md), providing additional insights to your data.
